# Data Cleansing and Preprocessing with Numpy

Welcome to the README for my data science project focusing on NumPy. 📊 This project demonstrates the practical application of Numpy in managing and analyzing large-scale datasets, emphasizing the critical role of data preparation in enabling successful analytics. 🚀

## Project Introduction

The goal of this project is to showcase how NumPy can be utilized for real-time analytics, particularly in handling and analyzing large volumes of data efficiently. 🌐

## Dataset Description

### Lending Club Loans Dataset
- **Description:** This dataset contains information on thousands of loans facilitated through the Lending Club platform.
- **Focus:** It highlights borrower risk profiles and various loan conditions.

### Exchange Rates Dataset
- **Description:** Historical exchange rates data between the US Dollar and the Euro sourced from Yahoo Finance.

## Objectives
- **Data Cleaning:** Prepare the datasets by addressing missing values and ensuring data consistency.
- **Real-Time Analytics:** Utilize NumPy for real-time data processing and analysis, demonstrating the scalability and efficiency of this Python package. 📈
- **Insight Generation:** Extract meaningful insights from the data to support informed decision-making processes.
